The Track Smartphone App (ViaApp) is an Android application designed for emergency management of unattended toll lanes. These lanes, which include automatic (AVI) and auxiliary/free lanes, lack staffed operators. The application's primary function is to address temporary malfunctions within automatic toll collection systems.
